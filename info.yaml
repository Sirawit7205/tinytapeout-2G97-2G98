# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.

# This will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Logic-2G97-2G98"
  description:  "Replication of TI's Little Logic 1G97 and 1G98 configurable logic gates."
  how_it_works: "This design replicates the circuit inside a TI configurable logic gates 74xx1G97 (and by including an inverted output, it will work as a 74xx1G98 as well). 
                 Since there are still I/O pins left, I included two of these configurables, and also one 74xx1G79 D Flip-Flop (again, an inverted output means this will also work as a 74xx1G80)."
  how_to_test:  "You could refer to TI's 1G79/1G80/1G97/1G98 datasheet to test the device according to the pinout listed below."
